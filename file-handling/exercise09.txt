Aboriginal Australians have inhabited the Greater Sydney region for at least 30,000 years, and their engravings and cultural sites are common. 
The traditional custodians of the land on which modern Sydney stands are the clans of the Darug, Dharawal and Eora peoples.
During his first Pacific voyage in 1770, James Cook charted the eastern coast of Australia, making landfall at Botany Bay. 
In 1788, the First Fleet of convicts, led by Arthur Phillip, founded Sydney as a British penal colony, the first European settlement in Australia.
After World War II, Sydney experienced mass migration and by 2021 over 40 per cent of the population was born overseas. 
Foreign countries of birth with the greatest representation are mainland China, India, the United Kingdom, Vietnam and the Philippines.
